The fairness is important in multi-task and multi-tenant systems. 
A bunch of IOops can unfairly block light operations because of coalse and merge in the IO system, and operation speed varies
 by types of operation 

For the current fair scheduling, the most popular method is time slice based fair scheduling. 
However, for the IO, especially flash storage, time-slice based scheduling may not appropriate.
The io operation responsiveness varies and inevitable with time-slice based scheduling; It harms for parallelism also 

The authors suggest fair queueing scheduler

+  Using tags, it manages virtual time based fair scheduling
+  Manages under-utilized tasks 
+  Using start time fair queueing, it achieves parrallsim on flash
