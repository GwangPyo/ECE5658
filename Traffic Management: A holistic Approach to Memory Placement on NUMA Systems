In previous work, researchers had focused on maximize locality of data, however, authors has found out 
the case increasing localit does not imporve performance. Rather, the authors point out that in modern
NUMA system, congestion on memory controllers and interconnnects are significiant bottleneck than remo-
te wire access. 
That is, adequate scheduling algorithms applied to solving congest controll can produec better perform-
ance. 

To prove their claim, they had experience to run a single application at a time use only one thread in
each application, and compared completion time and local memory.  They figure out that the remote memo-
ry latencies (20%) is lesser than the value measured in microbenchmarks (30%). 
Then, proved their hypothesis showing varient performance difference via difference memory replacement
algorithm (Inerleaving and First touch).

The authros suggest 3 mechanisms composing the goal.
1. Page co-location
2. Page interleaving 
3. Page replication 

And algorithm is given by 
1. decide activate Carrefour (the proposed algorithm in this paper)  
2. decide enable replication  # this procedure is conservative because it has risk of crucial overheads.
3. decide enable interleaving 
4. decide enable co-location  

Overhead 
The Carrefour algorithm has a few CPU over heads from IBS profiling and replication. As mentioned introduc-
tion, it was no more than 4%. But, there are memory overhead which cannot be igonred induced by replication.
For Streancluster benchmark, it was 400MB (353%). 

Energy consumption
There are another benefits from Carrefour algorithm, energy consumption, achieved by shorten completion time. 
The energy overhead from Carrefour algorithm was ignorable (2% on MG)
